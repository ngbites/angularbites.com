We want to define, for every entity, a sensible folder structure:</p><pre><code class="language-">- users
    - components
    - services
    - enums
        - roles.enum.ts
    - interfaces
        - user.interface.ts
    - models</code></pre><p>As you may have noticed, enums, interfaces and models all have their own folder, and it's important not to mix them to keep them well-organized.</p><h2>Entities Visibility</h2><p>There are a few rules that I tend to follow to make sure my project is well-organized.</p><h3>Use a shared library for entities used outside of your modules</h3><p>It's important to notice that a module should only contain the entities that are not shared with other modules, and hence that are private to that module.</p><p>But - Why?</p><p>Imagine we have a mono-repo with other applications or libraries written in different technologies (ex. Express, Stencil, React, etc.): you may not want to import your types from a different technology.</p><h4>ðŸ’¡ Solution</h4><p>Create a separate library (for example, called <code>@enterprise/interfaces</code>) that exposes your global entities. This is particularly recommended if you're using <code>Nx</code> to structure your project.</p><p>Otherwise, consider creating a typescript repository to expose your global entities to different repositories.</p><p>Admittedly, this is not great - but if you have a large team of teams using the same interfaces, it could be really important to keep them in sync.</p><h3>Never export an interface from a Service</h3><p>This is a pattern that I quite dislike - and I see used very often.</p><p>Defining an interface within a Service (or a Component) is generally fine - although not something I normally do. It's all good - as long as it is not exported.</p><p>Why is that?</p><ul><li>A component should not import a service simply to get an Interface</li><li>A component may simply use Typescript inference instead of using that Interface</li><li>If the interface is reused and is used in a way that inference could not work, then it should defined in its own file</li></ul><p>Hopefully this answered your questions - but if not, please do send me an <a href="mailto:giancarlo@frontend.consulting">email</a> and I'd love to expand on the subject.</p><p><em>Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed this article.
